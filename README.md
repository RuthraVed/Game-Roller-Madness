# Game-Roller-Madness
As a part of Coursera's Game Development Course, this is my first Game development project using Unity3d game engine.

### Objective
* Creating my first actual game from start to finish, called Roller Madness. 
* This ball rolling game helped me to strengthen my understanding of the Unit3d game engine, as well the concepts of physics, health and damage, pickups, enemies, spawners, a user interface, and a variety of visual and audio effects. 
* This is my direct passage into game development!

### Technologies Used
* Unity3d Game Engine
* C# Programming

### Note
I have made and uploaded three versions of this simple game -
1. Fun-Roller-Madness
2. Difficult-Levels-Roller-Madness
3. Themed-Roller-Madness

To run these versions on your system just download the respective folder and run the play file in Mozilla's Firefox browser. 

I would like to here which version you liked the most.
