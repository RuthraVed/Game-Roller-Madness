# Game-Roller-Madness
As a part of Coursera's Game Development Course, this is my first Game development project using Unity3d game engine.

### Objective
* Creating my first actual game from start to finish, called Roller Madness. 
* This ball rolling game helped me to strengthen my understanding of the Unit3d game engine, as well the concepts of physics, health and damage, pickups, enemies, spawners, a user interface, and a variety of visual and audio effects. 
* This is my direct passage into game development!

### Technologies Used
Unity3d Game Engine
C# Programming

### Note
A running version of this game could be found here, -- Builds/WebGL/index
Just download WebGL folder and run the index file in Mozilla's Firefox browser. I hope you like it.
